## Intro

HTML5 is the basic component of the web and together with CSS3, it creates web pages that we use every day in the browser. We define the meaning, structure and style of web content through these technologies.
In this project, HTML and CSS were used to build a clone of the Google interface.

## What did I build?

The project is focused on building the Google interface, taking special attention to its UT/UX to replicate its behaviour and style 100%. The interface is divided into the following sections:

* Header: Section where the main Google navigation is located, such as the user's profile picture, icons and menu.

* Main: Container section for the most important core elements of the interface:
logo, search bar, icons and buttons.

* Footer: Section containing extra information for the user, as well as hyperlinks at the bottom of the page. 

## Project Objectives

Learn how to use HTML5 tags and CSS3 properties, as well as identify core components of a website, to analyse and replicate them.
